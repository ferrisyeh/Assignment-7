<!-- Introduction -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-4 text-left">
  <h1 class="margin">Hey there,</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my top five picks for portfolios that I think are professional, sleek, and worthy of being used as references when
      building a portfolio. There were a few portfolios that I would have loved to put into this assignment (like <a href"http://rohan-b.com/"> this one</a>
      and <a href="http://getcoleman.com/"> this one</a>) but while I loved the aesthetics of those sites, I felt that the portfolio's contents were not 
      quite what I could use as an example for my own portfolio. I picked these five as a result of the following factors:
  </p>
  <br>
  <ul>
      <li> Skill set </li>
      <li> Professionalism </li>
      <li> Similar career paths</li>
      <li> Overall aesthetic </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>To jump to each portfolio that I talked about, click on the links in the navigation bar to get to each respective portfolio. You'll notice that 
      these portfolios have many projects based in UI/UX, visual design, or graphic design, and are similar in aesthetic!
  </p>
  <br>
  <h3> So without further ado, here are my top five picks! &#8595;</h3> 
</div>

<!-- Kenny Nieh -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-14">
      <h3><a id="kenny_nieh"><a href="http://www.kennynieh.com/">1. Kenny Nieh</a></a></h3>
      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/C4ftRbT.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>
          Kenny’s portfolio is a flat design that is very simple, very straightforward, and very professional. Each of the projects 
          are clear examples of his skillset – they document his role in each project, the process, and the final product. Furthermore, 
          Kenny includes a PDF of his resume which also outline his skills as a UI/UX designer on his About page. The color scheme is 
          monochromatic and clean, with pops of muted blue to accentuate and highlight his portfolio. He uses Sans-serif fonts, specifically 
          Open Sans and Proxima Nova, which further add to the professional image.

<!-- Elizabeth Kang -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-2 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-14"> 
        <h3><a id="elizabeth_kang"><a href="http://www.elizabethjkang.com/">2. Elizabeth Kang</a></a></h3>
        <img src="http://i.imgur.com/pjgrLvq.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>
          Elizabeth’s portfolio, like Kenny’s, is starkly minimalistic and again, is a flat design portfolio. Each of her projects 
          demonstrate her skillset as well, documenting her role and walking the viewer through her process. The color scheme is 
          monochromatic, with a few pops of color that relate to each of her projects, although notably most of the colors used are 
          cool colors. She uses sans-serif fonts as well, specifically Futura Pt and Proxima Nova, which also contribute to her portfolio’s 
          professional and minimalistic image. 
      </p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Jennet Liaw -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-14">
      <h3><a id="jennet_liaw"><a href="http://www.jennetliaw.com/"> 3. Jennet Liaw </a></a></h3>
      <img src="http://i.imgur.com/EIwWYqx.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>
          If not for the bright and vivid snapshots of each of her projects, Jennet’s portfolio would be as monochromatic as Elizabeth’s 
          and Kenny’s. However, despite the loud and eye-catching photos that serve as links to each of her projects, Jennet’s portfolio, 
          too, is simple and utilizes a flat design. She uses sans-serif fonts, specifically Brandon Grotesque and Futura Pt, but takes it 
          one step further by bolding and italicizing the fonts. Jennet’s portfolio is both professional and fun. 
      </p>

<!-- Dawn Lee -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-2 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-14"> 
        <h3><a id="dawn_lee"><a href="http://dawnleedesign.com/"> 4. Dawn Lee </a></a></h3>
       <img src="http://i.imgur.com/2WeuEl7.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>
          A stylistic combination of Jennet’s, Elizabeth’s, and Kenny’s portfolios, Dawn’s portfolio is a flat-design website that is 
          mostly black-and-white with pops of pink and yellow to make her logo and links stand out. Dawn captions each of her projects 
          with tags that tells the viewer what each project was about. Like the other portfolios above, Dawn uses sans-serif fonts, 
          giving her portfolio a clean and professional image. 
      </p>

<!-- Ishaan Kansal -->
<div class="container-fluid bg-1 text-center">    
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-14"> 
        <h3><a id="ishaan_kansal"><a href="http://ishaankansal.me/"> 5. Ishaan Kansal </a></a></h3>
       <img src="http://i.imgur.com/hQWVReu.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>
         Ishaan’s portfolio is definitely a little more interactive than the other ones. It is also a flat-design website that is 
         monochromatic and decorated with pops of color that relate to each project. The font that is used is Raleway, which is also sans-serif, 
         giving the website a beautiful professional image. Ishaan’s skillset is exemplified through each project, and his specialties are 
         summarized with the captions on each of his projects. It is a minimalistic and professional looking portfolio.
